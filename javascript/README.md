# Twitch Chatbot Javascript Sample
Here you find a simple Javascript chatbot that can help demonstrate how to interact with chat on Twitch. The project structure section will give you a quick overview of this code.

## Structure
`index.html`
Provides the user interface for the leaderboard and calls into the `chatClient` to connect to Twitch chat.

`chatbot.js`
Provides all of the inner workings for the chat bot including connecting, sending user credentials, and joining the correct channel. The leaderboard rendering code is also inside of this file.

`leaderboard.css`
Makes the leaderboard look...better than an unformatted table. Kappa.
